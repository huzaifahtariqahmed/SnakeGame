# Snake Game - A OOP Course Final Project

In this project, our goal was to make our own version of the famous game ‘Snake Xenzia’ in which a snake was trapped inside a walled square area, and some food was randomly placed inside the square region which the snake had to eat by moving itself into position using the arrow keys.

## Game Rules

- As the game starts snake is of a very small size and using the arrow keys the player has to direction the snake towards the food so that he eats it and the size of the snake increases.
- As more and more food get’s eaten by the snake, more and more points are achieved by the player.
- If the player directions the snake in such a way that the head of the snake get’s in contact with the snake’s body, the game gets over.
- If the snake’s head comes in contact with any of the 4 walls on each side, the gets over.
- The game isn’t about winning. It is just about how many points are collected before the player makes a mistake and the game ends due to the above two rules.
- However, if a player plays so well that the whole square area gets filled up with a snake’s body as he grows so much, the player will have mastered the game.
